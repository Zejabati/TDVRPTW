# TDVRPTW
**# Time Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window _ Hybrid Genetic Algorithm #**


This is a Python implementation of a solver for the Time-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (TDVRPTW) using a hybrid algorithm combining Genetic Alogorithm with Local Search and Large Neighborhood Search.
Time dependent travel time is estimated based on a discrete speed function based on speed profile on "A Hybrid Algorithm for Time-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows" by Binbin Pan, Zhenzhen Zhang, and Andrew Lim.
# Data
This repository includes the Solomon benchmark dataset for TDVRPTW, located in the data/ directory. You can use these data files to test and evaluate the solver's performance.
