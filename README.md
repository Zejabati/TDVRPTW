# TDVRPTW


Time Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window  Hybrid Genetic Algorithm
--

This project presents a Python implementation of a solver designed to address the Time-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (TDVRPTW).
The solver employs a hybrid algorithm that integrates Genetic Algorithms, Local Search, and Large Neighborhood Search techniques. 
To accommodate time-dependent travel times, the algorithm utilizes a discrete speed function derived from the speed profile described in the research paper 'A Hybrid Algorithm for Time-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows' authored by Binbin Pan, Zhenzhen Zhang, and Andrew Lim.

Data
